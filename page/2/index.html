      <p>The last couple of days, I’ve been toying with a little hobby project of mine.
The project is to rank players which player Quake Live duels, and I have reported on it before. I’ve been gathering duels since February 2012 up to now. The project is written as a hybrid. Most of the code for storage, retrieval and presentation is written in Erlang. The ranking code is written in Go.</p>

      <p>Let us assume the programming language market is effective and free. In this case, the best programming languages are the most popular ones: PHP, Javascript, Java, C#, C, C++ and so on. By definition, fringe languages can’t be the best languages. New fringe languages, like Go and Rust still has a chance in this world order, but long-time languages like Common Lisp, Haskell and OCaml are all dead. They have tried to show their worth for real-world development, but have been forever displaced into the dark corners of academia.</p>

      <p>We start out with the TL;DR treatise: The mnesia database is not CP, nor AP. And it cannot be CA, because CA doesn’t make any meaningful sense. In short, it is broken with respect to the CAP theorem.
Note: Things get subtle once you begin digging into the intricacies of the CAP theorem. I am not a native speaker of English, though Danish is “dangerously close”. I apologize in advance for my mistakes, and beg of you to write a correction if I stray too far from understandable prose.</p>

      <p>Roberto Aloi has written a nice write-up about QuickCheck with a lot of good advice[0]. This is my attempt to add to those notes and come up with a set of additional advice you can use.
There is one problem I hear again and again with QC. Which is “How do I start on doing this for this particular project?” The premise is that you have an existing project and want to magically QuickCheck it so you can know that it works.</p>

      <p>For some odd reason, we end up in situations in this industry which looks even more grave than earlier. In this post, I am going to rant. I am going to rant on two things, which I think contributes negatively. I wanted to write a nice clean post, but rants sometimes fits ones mood better, I guess.
JSON How did we get JSON? Well, we had ASN.1 which is a fine format for many things.</p>

      <p>Correct Erlang usage mandates you do not write any kind of defensive code. This is called intentional programming. You write code for the intentional control flow path which you expect the code to take. And you don’t write any code for the paths which you think are not possible. Furthermore, you don’t write code for data flow which was not the intention of the program.
 It is an effect, silly If an Erlang program goes wrong, it crashes.</p>

      <p>The cat is out of the bag. Now, since WhatsApp had success using Erlang, more people will gravitate toward the platform. One of the common things that will happen as a result is that people who do not understand the string handling capabilities of the Erlang BEAM VM will fail to use it correctly. This costs a lot of unneeded clock cycles and this post aims to thwart it.
 First of all, since this is rather VM specific, it also applies to Elixir users.</p>

      <p>In any computer system, we can split the system into the part which must be correct—no matter what happens; and the part where we don’t need the system to be correct all the time.
 A typical example of this is the operating system kernel. We believe the operating system kernel to be correct, but we don’t a priori trust the userland applications. If one of those fails, the kernel can take over, reap the process by killing it and reclaim the resources the process used.</p>

      <p>The Raven that used to sing—​and other stories
   Mark Jason Dominus wrote about &#34;Moonpig&#34;, which is his and Rik Signes work on building a billing system in Perl. He wrote up his story over on his blog. At Issuu, Francesco Zanitti, Anders Fugmann, and I wrote a system which has some similarities to Moonpig. This is a hash through that system. Currently, we mostly handle post-paid services.</p>

      <p>(Front Line Assembly: Civilization, Eastern Sun: In Emptiness)
 As an Erlang programmer I often claim that “You can’t pick parts of Erlang and then claim you have the same functionality. It all comes together as a whole”. This is true for many programming environments where the main components are built to be orthogonal from each other and the parts form the cohesive whole. A good example of this approach would be Go as well.</p>
