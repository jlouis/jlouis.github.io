<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jesper, I have this idea in which we&#8217;ll connect <em>all</em> of the worlds
Erlang systems to each other, imagine if every process could talk to
every other process, world-wide!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Joe Armstrong
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joe was never short on ideas when you spoke to him. At conferences, he
would engage people with his newest idea, or he would find people
across the room and connect them. This often resulted in new
acquaintances, interesting conversations, and new insights. Joe acted
as the fountain from which insights sprang. He always had a new
project going, and was keen to tell about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joe would speak to everyone. It didn&#8217;t matter if they were new to the
world of Erlang, or computers, or if you had 20 years of experience.
He would quickly find your level, and then discuss at that level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my mind, three rules embodied the ideas of Joe:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They were always practical and wanted to solve a grand problem with
computers. Most often, the limitations of physics played a role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They always felt a little bit crazy, mainly due to the novelty of
the idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were going to restructure your brain, and how you thought about
stuff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was writing a BitTorrent client for Erlang, Joe was quick to
comment on the code &#8220;This part uses defensive code style, you can
probably just let it crash.&#8221; It took some years for that lesson to
fully sink in, as it did with most of Joes stuff. He would gently
nudge you in a direction, and by following his trajectory, you
landed perfectly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people reading this will know Joe for his work on Erlang. But he
had lots of ideas, and not all of them pertained directly to Erlang
itself, though it was often the vehicle. He had a keen interest in
music and did collaboration on the Sonic Pi with Sam Aaron. Up until
recently, Joe was working on improving wiki tooling. In particular,
he&#8217;d realized how he needed a quine,<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> the wiki should contain its own source code
so it could reproduce itself. This would ensure the longevity of the
wiki. This work was in April 2019, so he was working on stuff up until
his untimely death.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joe liked to find minimal solutions to problems. He would strip layer
upon layer off a problem until he had the core. He created a stack of
universal binary formats, UBF. The ingenious part of this was that to
transfer a term, one would transfer a <em>program</em> which when executed on
a small stack-based virtual machine would yield said term. And the
commands were chosen from the printable ASCII alphabet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The higher layers in the stack was the basis for a lot of discussions
I had with Joe. Both of us agreed that what happens &#8220;inside&#8221; an
Erlang process wasn&#8217;t that interesting in the grand scale of things.
It was the communication which was important, and it should have a
contract system. Joe had certainly invented most of this before I
even started looking at Erlang as a language. And I still&#8212;&#8203;to this
day&#8212;&#8203;believe that this is future of protocol communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see how visionary Joe was, his idea was to use such a contract
system to get any Erlang process on any node to talk to another Erlang
process, somewhere out in the universe. Essentially, this gives you
&#8220;Serverless&#8221; operation, so he was a couple of years ahead of the
pack on that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Joe also wanted to mix this with a content addressable storage
spanning the internet. He would speak fondly of IPFS which to a large
extent was this vision. The main idea is to generate the reference key
for data from the data itself, usually a cryptographic hash over the
data. This in turn provides integrity: if the data changes, so does
its key. Now, if you refer to data by its key, then you can verify you
got the right data. Joe wanted to use this as a basis for software:
&#8220;I can send you the hash, and you can fetch the library if you don&#8217;t
have it.&#8221; he told me. He also wanted to use this idea to protect old
software so &#8220;It could still run after many years.&#8221;--another reason
Joe preferred minimalistic approaches to software. &#8220;You see, a
package version is the hash of its source code, not a version number,
that would be silly.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He was adamant on making computers useful.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The greatest brain restructure, however, was always in the idea that
your abstract logic of a program <em>has</em> to execute in the physical
environment. This meant coping with failure when it happened as the
only way to build robust software. Programming without this profound
insight&#8212;&#8203;software cannot proactively remove all error&#8212;&#8203;is as silly as
it is dangerous in hindsight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you embrace fault tolerance, then you have the feeling of a burden
released, and programs gets far easier to write. Of course, the more
seasoned programmer knows when you can be proactive and when you have
to be reactive. But if there one thought which has shaped the way I
think about programming the most, it is this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second greatest brain restructure was Joe&#8217;s dismissal of
performance in software. In a post to the Erlang mailing list, Joe
would come up with the following table:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This is what we do: (We = ///)

    1) hack it in erlang
    2) fast enough - ship it
    3) tweak the erlang
    4) fast enough? - ship it
    5) hack it in C?
    6) fast enough - ship it
    7) tweak the C
    8) fast enough? - ship it
    9) make an FPGA
    10) fast enough - ship it
    11) make an ASIC
    12) fast enough - ship it

As you go down this list things cost more and more - step 11 costs
1M$/try - to pass step 9
you need to have a high volume product (10's to hundreds of thousands of units)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core idea is that if you want to go really fast, you need to
implement hardware specific to the problem, and you can only hope to
tweak the software so far in performance. And he would make a point
about setting up a specified target before starting the tweakery, so
you&#8217;d know when to stop. Over the years, I&#8217;ve veered in the same
general direction as Joe.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing I liked about Joe was his fearless approach to computing and
to life. He&#8217;d never bow to authority. He&#8217;d would never be afraid to
provoke if it was necessary. He never ever stopped R&amp;D. He would
tinker with things until he understood them, then find something new
to look at. But only after he told you about his findings. Sharing was
his modus operandi.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At conferences&#8212;&#8203;in which Joe was an attendant&#8212;&#8203;there would be this
hallway track going on where people would talk with Joe. A slot would be
skipped here and there. But some interesting conversation would be
had, and people would convene around him in a circle that grew ever
larger. I&#8217;ve watched more than once when a &#8220;innocent bystander&#8221; was
drawn into his web of stories, findings, and insights.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a speaker with Joe in the audience was always a blast. Once he
sensed he was allowed to interact, you could be sure he would
&#8220;heckle&#8221; your talk in the most awesome way. It only took a smirk and
you saying <code>{hello, joe}</code> and that would be his cue. We should have
mic&#8217;ed him up at times.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When he did speak up, he would often frame a question such that it put
a speaker in a position where they could really show their work. Never
have I heard a bad question by Joe.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was the Joe I knew. I think we owe him a lot with regard to
pushing software and computer science ahead. The best we can do is to
make sure his grand ideas are not lost upon us, and that they are
implemented in the future to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then perhaps, we will reach a point where Joe&#8217;s prediction from
this Month will ring true:</p>
</div>
