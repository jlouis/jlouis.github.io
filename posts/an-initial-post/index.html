<p>I tend to stir up things over on blogger, mostly writing the blog
<a href="http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/" class="bare">http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/</a> —but I am considering writing and
using Medium instead to provide stuff, since the platform just seems
nicer. My Ramblings are mostly-technical and they tend to contain a lot
of code in them, but the way I tend to add new blog posts is somewhat
indirect. I write the post itself in my trusty Acme editor—as
markdown—and then I convert that into HTML which I then push in on top
of Blogger. I almost never use the editor in Blogger because I hate it.
So writing on Medium is an attempt. An attempt to see if the platform
would be a nicer way to write posts and if I would prefer it to writing
in the Editor.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Aside from 2018:</em> In 2013, Medium was a quite nice platform. But over
the years, they destroyed the platform totally, making it a platform
where you have to pay in order to read posts and entries. It was free
originally.</p>
