    <div class="paragraph">
<p>So, I have this QLGlicko project. It consists of a web scraper which
takes in duel matches played in the game of Quake Live—and stores them
in a Postgres database. These duels are then analyzed and I run the
Glicko 2 (see <a href="http://glicko.net/" class="bare">http://glicko.net/</a>) ranking system on them to tell people
who are currently the best player on a given map.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system works well, but I was tired of maintaining it on a Linux
machine for several reasons. One, Linux is hard to maintain and things
change underneath faster than I like. Two, I have much more experience
maintaining FreeBSD machines. Three, I can get proper built-in ZFS
support on FreeBSD. Hence I decided to move the database onto FreeBSD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the migration went well. I dumped the database, installed
FreeBSD, installed Postgres 9.3 (to avoid having to toy with SysV shared
memory). Tuned the database. And tried to import. First problem is that
Linux used the fake locale called “en_dk.utf-8”—so I had to fake it
and install that. Next problem was that I used the “uuid-ossp”
EXTENSION in Linux. This one has several problems on FreeBSD, mostly
related to PIC code and the fact that it will crash the database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I changed the code to <em>inject</em> the UUID data rather than producing it
on the database side. And then I suddenly had duplicate key constraint
problems on an UNIQUE INDEX. Running SELECT queries showed no such
trouble with the index and there were no entries with more than a single
entry. This is to be expected due to the index being UNIQUE. But the
insertion or update code would soundly fail. I was wondering what went
wrong and began digging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is what happened: the “uuid-ossp” code had managed to insert a
row into the database before it crashed. So this went under the radar of
the index and now we had trouble! There is an extra entry in the
database—violating the index—but it does not detect that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Worse, when we query, the data can be served from the index alone, since
most data in the table are frozen. This means we begin getting really
evil and odd violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running a DROP on the index and then trying to recreate the index again
makes the error show up. And now I understood what went wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution was pretty simple: Restore the database from a backup.
Remove any trace of “uuid-ossp” and then start the database again. Now
the index works as expected and the database doesn’t crash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TL;DR—Beware of extensions that doesn’t work on your platform of choice!</p>
