      <title>An Evil Postgres Bug</title>

      <description>So, I have this QLGlicko project. It consists of a web scraper which takes in duel matches played in the game of Quake Live—and stores them in a Postgres database. These duels are then analyzed and I run the Glicko 2 (see http://glicko.net/ ranking system on them to tell people who are currently the best player on a given map.
 The system works well, but I was tired of maintaining it on a Linux machine for several reasons.</description>

      <description>I tend to stir up things over on blogger, mostly writing the blog http://jlouisramblings.blogspot.com/ —but I am considering writing and using Medium instead to provide stuff, since the platform just seems nicer. My Ramblings are mostly-technical and they tend to contain a lot of code in them, but the way I tend to add new blog posts is somewhat indirect. I write the post itself in my trusty Acme editor—as markdown—and then I convert that into HTML which I then push in on top of Blogger.</description>
