  <div class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>(Front Line Assembly: Civilization, Eastern Sun: In Emptiness)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an Erlang programmer I often claim that &#8220;You can’t pick parts of
Erlang and then claim you have the same functionality. It all comes
together as a whole&#8221;. This is true for many programming environments
where the main components are built to be orthogonal from each other and
the parts form the cohesive whole. A good example of this approach would
be Go as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A compelling way of deploying software is what supposedly originated
with FLEX (Alan Kay). The program, the system and its data are all kept
inside an <em>image</em> which can be persisted to disk and restarted later. In
essence we specify which world we operate in by giving an image. Many
Smalltalk systems utilize this notion of images. So do Common Lisp
systems. And they even understand how to reconnect to networks and
reopen files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang provides its own, weaker, mechanism for assembling software
called a <em>release</em>. A release consists of the runtime together with a
set of Erlang applications. They are started as a whole—in a specific
order. The same release is usually booted across several machines if we
want to have resilience against hardware faults. The big shift compared
to images is that there are no on-disk persistence. The ideology is
different: the system should never stop, so even if one <em>node()</em> in the
cluster is stopped, the data is on other nodes as well and lives. Erlang
systems also allow for seamless upgrades from one release to another
while they are running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there are some resemblance from Common Lisp / Smalltalk images and
Erlang releases. While they don’t persist the data, Erlang images do
define a separate enclosed system with no link to the original system.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strength of these persistent models come apparent late in the
development cycle. Software usually goes through several phases</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\(\[\text{Analysis} \rightarrow
\text{Design} \rightarrow
\text{Implementation} \rightarrow
\text{Test} \rightarrow
\text{Deploy} \rightarrow
\text{Maintenance}]\)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to stress that development of software is a dynamic
activity. We repeatedly change the software in production by layering
more and more complexity/features on top of the system. We also
dynamically fix bugs in the software while it is in production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The recent years, development tends to so-called Agile methods—where
there are many small dynamic iterations of the software construction
process running all at the same time. We have social tooling in place
which tries to achieve this (Scrum, Kanban,…), and we have technical
tooling in place to reach the goal (git, Mercurial,…).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; part is very expensive. Maintaining running software
has periodic costs associated with it. In a world where everything is a
service, we have to pay operators, pay for hardware resources,
developers, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we program, we try to remove errors early. We employ static type
systems, we do extensive testing, we use static analysis. Perhaps we
even use probalistic model checkers like QuickCheck, exhaustive model
checkers like SPIN or prove our software in Coq. We know, inherently,
that eradicating bugs early on in the software life cycle means less
work in the maintenance phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But interestingly, all this only <em>raises</em> the bar for errors. When we
have done all our hard work, the errors that do remain are all of the
subtle kind. These are errors which were not caught by our initial
guardian systems. Most static type systems won’t capture the class of
faults which has to do with slow algorithms or excessive memory
consumption for instance. A proper benchmark suite will—but only if we
can envision the failure case up front.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The class of faults that tend to be <em>interesting</em> is the class that can
survive a static type check. The mere fact we could not capture it by a
static analysis in the compile phase makes the error much more subtle.
Also, it often means they are much harder to trigger in production
systems. If the fault furthermore survives the test suite it becomes
even more <em>interesting</em>. The viral strain has a certain basic DNA which
mutated it so it could get past two barriers of correctness tests. Now
it becomes a latent bug in your software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Aside:</em> I tend to absolutely love static type systems. I enjoy them a
lot when I program in Go, Standard ML, OCaml or Haskell. I am all for
the richer description that comes with having a static type system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a great power in being able to say \($v \colon \tau$\)
rather than just \($v$\)—exactly because the former
representation is <em>richer</em> in structure. Richer structure helps
documentation, makes it possible to pick better in-memory
representations, makes the programs go faster and forces a more coherent
programming model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet, I also recognize that most of the errors caught by static type
systems are <strong>not</strong> <em>interesting.</em> They are of the kind where a simple run
of the program will find them instantly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>End of Aside.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_concurrency_and_distribution_failures">Concurrency and Distribution failures</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When systems have faults due to concurrency and distribution, debuggers
will not work. The problem is that you can’t stop the world and then go
inspect it. A foreign system will inspect an answer in time or it will
time out. Many modern systems have large parts of which you have no
direct control anymore. Such is life in the Post-1991 era of computing
where the internet defines the interface to your program and its
components. An Erlang system with two nodes is enough to be problematic.
Even if I could snapshot one node, the other node will carry on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same is true for concurrency errors. They often incorporate race
conditions which must trigger. Attaching a debugger alters the execution
schedule making the race condition disappear in the process. The only
way to debug such systems is by analysing post-mortem traces of what
went wrong—or by inspecting the systems online while they are running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make matters worse, a lot of races only occur when data sizes are
increased to production system batches. Say you have a small write
conflict in the data store due to inappropriate transactional
serialization and isolation. If your test system has few users, this
conflict will never show up. And if it does, you will disregard it as a
one-time fluke that will never happen again. Yet—on the production
system, as you increase capacity, this problem will start to occur. The
statistical &#8220;Birthday Paradox&#8221; will come and rear its ugly head and
you will be hitting the conflict more and more often. Up until the point
where it occurs multiple times a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conclusion, capturing these kinds of bugs up front is deceptively
hard.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_erlangshell">The Erlang Shell</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Erlang shell is a necessary tool for producing correct software. Its
usefulness is mostly targeted at the maintenance phase, but it is also
useful in the initial phases of development. A running Erlang system can
be connected to while it is running:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(qlglicko@127.0.0.1)3&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This provides a REPL so you can work with the software. But note that
this is a REPL on the <em>running production system</em>. If I run commands on
the system:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(qlglicko@127.0.0.1)3&gt; qlg_db:players_to_refresh(1000). {ok,[]}
(qlglicko@127.0.0.1)4&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hook into running processes. In this case <em>qlg_db</em> which does
connection pooling towards the Postgres database. This allows me to go
probe the system while it is running to check for its correct operation.
Any exported functionality can be probed from the shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I often keep a module around, named <em>z.erl</em> which I can compile and
inject into the running system:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>(qlglicko@127.0.0.1)6&gt; c("../../z.erl").
{ok,z}
(qlglicko@127.0.0.1)7&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This dynamically compiles and loads the <em>z</em> module into the running
system. It makes the functions of the module available for system
introspection and manipulation. When debugging hard-to-find bugs on
systems, you <em>need</em> this functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yes, if you want, Erlang nodes contains the <em>compiler</em> application
so they can compile modules.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Erlang, linking is deliberately &#8220;as late as possible&#8221;. This means
you can change software in the system while it is running. There is no
linker phase up front at compile time. Linkage is done when you call
another module. Yes, this costs performance. But on the other hand, it
means you can always rely on the system calling the newest loaded
version of the module. The ability to hot-patch a system while it is
running can help a lot. You don’t have to interrupt the system for small
fixes for instance. If you know that you only changed a single module in
your test build, you can opt to just push that compiled byte code to
production and then inject it into that system. As long as you
systematically add the change to your standard deployment pipeline, this
works.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shell also provides a lot of nice tooling to help you when you are
looking for problems in a system:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is built-in job-control in the sense of the sh(1) shell. You can
have several shells open at the same time. You can reconnect to shells,
either locally or remote. And you can kill shells which have hung for
one reason or the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erlang has built in trace capabilities. These provide DTrace-like
behaviour on the system directly without effort. Enabling tracing only
impacts the traced modules and it is generally non-intrusive (unless you
make a mistake when setting trace patterns, heh). You can mask events:
only when this process calls. And only these two functions. And only
when the 3rd passed parameter is 37. The Erlang shell makes this all
possible dynamically on the running system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to know what state a given process has? Fear not, you have online
introspection via the shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to know how many messages there is the inbox of a process? Fear
not…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to insert a new log statement? Recompile the code and hot-deploy
it via the shell. Fear not…</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And all this <em>without</em> service interruption. And you get all this for
free, just because you picked Erlang as the implementation language.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the thing: the first time you use the Erlang shell in production
to fix a hard-to-debug problem it becomes very very hard to live without
it. I’d willingly give up static typing for the ability to look at the
running system. Problems that survive past the tests and into production
tend to be sinister and evil. And subtly elusive. You need a system
there where you can go and inspect it, while the error is occuring in
production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the same traits that made UNIX a success (and what makes Plan9
alluring and appealing). Your system can be inspected and manipulated
while it is being developed and changed dynamically. Except that in
Erlang, we have much finer grained control over the running UNIX-process
since we can go inside it and inspect running processes inside the node.</p>
