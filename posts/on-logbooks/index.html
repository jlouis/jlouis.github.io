    <div class="paragraph">
<p>My friend, Michael T. Richter, presented me with a nice concept from
engineering. The <em>logbook</em>. The concept is extremely simple: you keep a
log of your work, so you can refer back to it later. Yet, there are
relatively few in Computer Science who does that, which is a sad state
of affairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The odd thing is that most computer scientists do know the importance of
logging in an application. You see these elaborate logging frameworks
that can log at different log levels, can forward logs between machines
and so on. Yet—it looks like the CS people forgot that the same logging
could apply to your own work.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My Log comprises two files. One for work and one for personal projects.
In each file, I keep track of dates. The file is pure text, though I use
utf-8 encoding, so I have access to full Unicode, which I exploit fully.
I have the following in the file in the acme(1) editor:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>&lt;date +%Y-%m-%d</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>which can be run to enter the current date at the cursor position. I
tend to jot down the projects that are <em>in progress</em>. My log is not a
TODO list! I’d rather track stuff I have done than stuff I don’t have
time to do. Having a log gives me some immediate benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I can run <em>grep</em> on old entries. This is tremendously efficient. I
often write down shell-oneliners, R scripts, hostnames too volatile
for <em>.ssh/config</em>, results from benchmarks, test failures, meeting
outcomes and so on. I can find old stuff as long as I remember that I
wrote it down at some point in time. I also keep links to papers, Issues
I am working on, source files and so on. My editor of choice, acme(1),
allows one to write <em>file:/REGEX</em> to open a file and then perform a
search within that file based on the regular expression I give. In
effect, I have full history tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can answer the question ``What did you do two weeks ago?'' with
ease. It also means I can gather knowledge about what kind of work I am
currently doing and for what purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The log acts as a tool for improving the process. By keeping track of
what is being done, I can look back and see what can be done better.
This allows me to run an iterative quality improvement process on my
development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The log allows me to use the &#8220;Hemmingway trick&#8221;, which is leaving a
sentence before it is done and finished. It is then easier to go back
and pick up from where you left. By tracking what is currently in
progress, I have an easier time entering flow again on the piece of code
I am working on. Switching ``context'' is also way easier. Since I can
write down where I am currently on one part and then switch to another
part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the log tracks stuff in progress, I can quickly figure out if I
am starting too many new projects and not finishing any of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The log allows me to clear my brain once in a while since it has been
documented elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is way easier to have <em>focus</em> with a log of what is being done,
vastly improving efficiency and output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personally, I think the most important part is that this has vastly
improved my process. Especially when hunting for bugs. I tend to write
down what I know and what hypothesis I have. Then I try to devise some
experiment that can cut through the hypothesis and cleave up the
possibilities. Bug finding becomes much faster when you approach it like
this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another part of the process which also has improved is the approach to
writing new code:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I try to document the purpose of the new piece of code. That way, I
make sure I know why it is important to implement this part—and I
document that for future reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I often write down how hard I think the code is to complete. This
gives me a benefit later when I can go back and see if I was right or
wrong with the estimate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we had multiple solutions, that is documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a test comes up with a surprising result, that is documented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a consequence, you do less work and better quality. The concept of
the <em>logbook</em> is hereby passed on to the reader.</p>
