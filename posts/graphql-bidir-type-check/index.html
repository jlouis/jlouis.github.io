    <div class="paragraph">
<p>The core idea of GraphQL is this: let clients have a small, typed,
total, functional (declarative) language where they can push programs to
the server side. The server then interprets these programs and
provides data to the client. The natural core for this is a lambda
calculus: a GraphQL <em>fragment</em> is a lambda over the free variables of
that fragment, for instance. A <em>query</em> is also a lambda, but no
variables are free, and it is “exported” for others to use. The only
reason it <em>isn’t</em> a full functional core is because the current
language is more familiar to typical client programmers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Aside:</em> GraphQL is the ultimate function-as-a-service implementation.
In typical <em>serverless</em> implementations of the FaaS scheme a client
can execute a singular function on the server side at a time, without
caring about the underlying server infrastrucutre and its maintenance.
GraphQL amends this by having the client push a program to the server
side, so part of the client runs server-side, using the predetermined
functions in the GraphQL Schema. How the functions are implemented,
executed and maintained is ignored by the client. It only knows of the
GraphQL endpoint as a factor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This empowers clients and makes software be driven by client code. It
also improves latency since the program is executed server-side with
<em>locality</em>. And it empowers clients with flexibility insofar the
server can evolve and adapt without clients having to change. <em>End of Aside</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because we are working with a language, the best way to approach the
problem is to treat it as such. Processing GraphQL requests runs the
normal gauntlet of a interpreter:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scan incoming byte stream into tokens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parse tokens into an abstract syntax tree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elaborate the tree and type check it as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute: use an interpreter to execute the request</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to stress interpretation is often enough. In a typical
implementation, the work done in the execution phase is not where time
is spent. Usually, we measure the time in μs for the interpretation
step, whereas reading data is usually more costly in the ms-range. If
you have any distributed access in the query, that is going to be
where time is spent. The only counter-example is when you have all
data in memory on the Erlang node, readily available. In principle,
you could pre-compile an execution to Erlang code, and then directly
execute said code if this proved to be too slow. But we aren’t there
yet in the current implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Erlang implementation currently uses interpretation directly on
the AST and doesn’t compile via a Lambda calculus core. This, I think,
is mostly a mistake to be fixed at a later point in time.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_type_checking">Type checking</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the GraphQL <a href="https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/">specification</a>,
there are two sections of interest: <em>Type System</em> and <em>Validation</em>.
Where you <em>can</em> execute a GraphQL request without worrying about its
well-typedness, it seems rather futile to do so. So we decided to bake
the validation into a proper checking phase in the engine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In hindsight, we think this has been the correct choice. The language
is quite amenable to a classic operational semantics on its types. The
transformation into a proper logic uncovered many corner cases in the
specification which needed clarification. Also, we’ve given opinions
from time to time on the specification based on what is possible in a
logic, and also what is easy to implement in a logic. This helps
coherence of the language quite a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first type checker we wrote were based on a classic algorithm. It
had many bugs, mostly because it was built and extended as we went
along implementing more and more language features. So with that
experiment behind us, we embarked on the idea to rewrite it using a
more modern style, hopefully simplifying and squashing further bugs in
the process. At this point, we had a sizable test suite, so a rewrite
would not introduce too many futher faults.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’m pretty sure bidirectional type checking is part of the folk-lore,
but there are some really good expositions on them. One is written by
David R. Christensen, and another by Frank Pfenning:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/bidirectional.pdf" class="bare">http://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/bidirectional.pdf</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15312-f04/handouts/15-bidirectional.pdf" class="bare">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15312-f04/handouts/15-bidirectional.pdf</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you start using this style of type checker, you will want to
write every type checker in this style.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_core_idea">The core idea</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key observation is that type checking can be split into a couple
of different building blocks. Once these blocks are established, we
can recombine them, as you would in typical algebraic fashion. There
are obvious similarities to attribute grammars, as we will see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We split type checking into three building blocks. We annotate each
entry with a <code>+</code> if they are given (have positive mode in the
relation), and <code>-</code> if they are returned by the algorithm (have
negative mode):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synthesis/Inference: <code>G+ |- e+ ⇒ t-</code> given an environment <code>G</code> and an
expression <code>e</code>, we figure out a type for it, <code>t</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking: <code>G+ |- e+ ⇐ t+</code> check that the expression has given type
<code>t</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsumption: <code>sub t+ s+</code> check that the type <code>t</code> is a subtype of
<code>s</code>. That is that <code>t</code> “fits inside” <code>s</code> in an obvious fashion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason one wants to split into these building blocks are that the
type checker becomes simpler. You so-to-speak use checking to push
down information you have into subexpressions, and then use synthesis
on the way to switch judgement mode and gather knowledge about types.
This pendulum of back-and forth between the two building blocks makes
a lot of type checking rules simple. The subtype relation is used to
verify you don’t break rules along the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Example:</em> If we have a type which is non-nullable in GraphQL: <code>t!</code>
and we are checking it against a type <code>s</code> which is nullable. Then this
amounts to ignoring the non-nullability and check <code>t</code> against <code>s</code>.
This is because a non-nullable value is “stricter” than a nullable
one and fits nicely inside it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical pendulum operation when checking a request is that of a
schema-lookup. To check against a given type we synthesize a
schema-lookup, hence obtaining a proper type for the subexpression,
which we then proceed to check.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is omitted in the above, compared to the real checker, is that we
also <em>elaborate</em> the AST. We annotate the tree with the types we
found. This eliminates a lot of later hash-table lookups because the
needed type information is already in the tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, literal values are input-coerced in the type checker. This is
done as a partial execution of the query for the parts which are
constant.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_flow_polarity">Flow Polarity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second observation is that in GraphQL, there are two major flows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input: Client → Server (positive flow)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Output: Server → Client (negative flow)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In turn, every GraphQL term is either present in one or both of these
flows. For instance, an <em>input type</em> has positive flow, whereas an
object type returned has negative flow. There are also nonpolar flows
in scalars and enums.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flows guide how one should check against types. In the positive
flow direction, we cannot trust the client, but the GraphQL schema on
the server side can be trusted. Hence, we should recurse over the types
of the schema, not what the client provided. This guards against the
client omitting a required argument for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast, the negative flow reverses the recursor: here, we are
only interested in what the client wants, so we only check those
values. If the schema/server provides more values but they are
illegal, they are ignored since the client did not request them.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using these observations, it is possible to figure out many questions
one might have when writing the type checker. Most loops write
themselves based on the flow rules. And most checking rules writes
themselves via the three bidirectional building blocks. The
consequence is a small and lean type checker for GraphQL.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_results">Results</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_code_size">Code size</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach used here currently amounts to about 1000 LOC, including
comments. The reference implementation uses around 3500 LOC on the
same thing, also including comments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, our code reads as typical operational semantics, which
makes it far easier to validate and verify. Many bugs have been fixed
by addition of a simple rule, or rearrangement of the rule checking
order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If one wanted to translate GraphQL type rules into a logical framework
such as Twelf, or into a proof assistant such as Agda, it should be
fairly straightforward. Also, the static semantics in operational form
should be easier to write down if one wanted a more formal approach to
the type checking of GraphQL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_speed">Speed</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The type checker usually runs much faster than the interpreter phase.
A query is static, and not executed per fetched node, whereas the
interpreter has to walk over data returned. Factors of 1000:1 in favor
of the type checker is not unheard of. This argues one should write
the type checker for simplicity rather than speed.</p>
