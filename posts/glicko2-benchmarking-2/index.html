    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Glicko2 is a ranking system for duel games. I use it to rank Quake Live
duels. The idea is to find a value, the <em>strength</em> of a player, called R
in the system. The higher the R value, the better the player.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does Glicko2 estimate R? It looks at historical data and uses
bayesian methods to estimate the current strength of a player. Like all
other systems, there are parameters we can tune for a set of players and
a set of duels:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What initial R value should we pick for new players? We could pick
1500 as the base, but it may be that there are better initial values
than this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What initial RD value should we pick for new players? The RD value
measures a <em>belief</em> in a given R-value. A large RD means we have
relatively little information and hence can’t trust the R value as much
for rathing purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about the initial Sigma-value? The Sigma-value is used to adjust
ratings for players which are consistently fooling the rating system. It
accounts for the situation where a player has been ``locked&#39;&#39; to a given
rating and then suddenly improves. In other rating systems, it would
take a long time to move that players R value to the correct position.
But Glicko2 will detect this and adjust the Sigma for the player,
allowing for greater R-strides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about the value of Tau? Tau is a global value which controls how
much power Sigma has. Games with high random variability needs a low Tau
around 0.2 to account for randomness in games. Games with lower
variability can run with higher Tau-values. Perhaps as high as 1.2 at
maximum. In game types with high Tau-scores, there is very little random
behaviour. Hence a win or a loss is more decisive and Sigma should
adjust with a greater factor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 4 different values spans a 4-dimensional space. We can try to tune
the values for the game type we are looking at. By doing so, we can hope
to find good values which optimize the ranking system to the game type.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_nelder_mead_numerical_optimization">Nelder-Mead numerical optimization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many optimization algorithms. The original algorithm when I
operated in pure Erlang was quite computationally intensive. I used the
concept of <em>Simulated Annealing</em> as an optimization heuristic. This
algorithm works well, but requires many computations in order to find
good values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had experiments of Glicko2 computations in Erlang, Go &amp; OCaml. Given
that the fastest Erlang code runs a round in 8us, OCaml in 2us and Go in
1us, I decided to focus on Go for the next round of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want a more intelligent search for an optimum. One algorithm is
Nelder-Mead from 1965. This algorithm has some trouble in certain
situations. And it may converge to a wrong point. But it often works
well in practice. So I set out to implement the algorithm for Go. The
efforts are here, including tests and benchmarks:
<a href="http://github.com/jlouis/nmoptim" class="bare">http://github.com/jlouis/nmoptim</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NM is nice for our ranking work since it does not need numerical
derivatives of the function being computed. Rather, you start with a
<em>simplex</em> which you then iteratively move around. You can imagine a
fishing net spanning the whole sea. NM proceeds by moving the fishing
net according to some rules in order to find the fish you are searching
for. In this case the minimum of the function at hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nelder-Mead by itself is not easy to make parallel. But the ranking
function is trivially parallelizable. So I opted to do operations in
parallel and then speed up the ranking code. By using sync.WaitGroup in
Go, I immediately got to around 500% CPU usage on an 8 core machine. So
now I am blocked on speedup. Getting 5/8 of the cores to do meaningful
work and a factor of around 5 in speedup is nice. My ranking runs are
about 5 times faster in wall-clock as well. And that is disregarding
other possible optimizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, we find a good value in 22 iterations of Nelder-Mead with
45 function evaluations. I guess it was not that important to speed up
the computations after all since Erlang would have been able to run
this, albeit in hours rather than minutes. Go completes the run in in
about 3 minutes on my current Ivy Bridge Core-i7 laptop, which is a fine
speed for 2.5 million quake matches. It also ranks in around 925ns per
match which is around the numbers I got in my Glicko2 benchmarks for a
single test match.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_nextsteps">The next steps</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can now optimize in Go, but there are still more work to be done
before it is on par with the Erlang code:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to be able to rank pairs of \{Player, Map}. This is rather
easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prediction code only runs on the last round out of 99. It should
preferably run prediction on the last 4-5 rounds instead so the
predictions even out over a larger area. This will account for a single
round of matches becoming too crazy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranking expected scores need some clamping which I am not doing
currently, but that should be easy to add as well.</p>
