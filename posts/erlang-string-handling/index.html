<p>The cat is out of the bag. Now, since WhatsApp had success using Erlang, more
people will gravitate toward the platform. One of the common things that will
happen as a result is that people who do not understand the string handling
capabilities of the Erlang BEAM VM will fail to use it correctly. This costs a
lot of unneeded clock cycles and this post aims to thwart it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, since this is rather VM specific, it also applies to Elixir users.
The VM basically handles strings the same way, so you should be thinking in the
same general direction as I am doing here, for Erlang. Though Elixir, to the
best of my knowledge, maps its string type onto binaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing to understand is that Erlang is a functional language first and
foremost. This means, among other things, data will be immutable by construction
and there is no way to circumvent that. It also means certain tricks pertaining
to ephermeral mutability is out the window. And it would be outright against the
spirit of Erlang to have mutable data in any form.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_when_you_should_avoid_using_erlang_in_the_firstplace">When you should avoid using Erlang in the first place</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang as a language fares bad at programs where you have a <em>small</em>
computational kernel which <em>has to</em> be extremely fast. This is the case for a
lot of heavyweight processing tasks. It is often better to take your kernel and
move it into another language, or in some cases move the kernel onto an FPGA or
into hardware, depending on your needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the problem, it may not be efficient to spend your time
implementing the code in Erlang. Unless you plan to utilise some of the other
Erlang strengths, like robustness, you may be better off by just implementing
your system in Go or Clojure. Alternatively, you can write a NIF and then handle
the core kernel in C. Don’t use Erlang when another tool solves the job in a way
better and way faster way. A rough estimate is that C code is 20-50 times faster
for tight computational kernels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Erlang language is built for handling more complex interactions where the
raw execution speed matter less and the program structure matters more. If your
system has no specific kernel which is executing for heavyweight processing,
then Erlang might suit your needs. If your system is bound to memory or I/O then
Erlang may be <em>very</em> suitable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You goal is to get most processing out of the emulator loop and onto the BEAM VM
core. The runtime core is very efficient at handling large amounts of data and
many structures are built such that they can sustain heavy load. A good way to
look at this is with the linux perf(1) tool. Run perf on the beam.smp emulator
and if <code>beam_emu.c</code> is spending too much time, chances are you are processing
heavy. Even processing-heavy applications I have written tend to have 20% time
spent in the emulator loop. The consequence is you can’t win much by replacing
the interpreter with a JIT or a native code compiler. You can only, at best,
squeeze the 20% so it is limited how much faster you can get the code by doing
this.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside: A JIT would still be useful so more of the Erlang system could be written
in Erlang rather than C. But for most code, it is not given a priori it would
yield a speedup.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_is_a_string">What is a string()?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Erlang string type is implemented as a single-linked-list of unicode code
points. That is, if we write “Hello” in the language, this is represented as
<code>[$H, $e, $l, $l, $o]</code>. The overhead of this representation is massive. Each
Cons-cell use 8 bytes for the code point and 8 bytes for the pointer to the next
value. This means that the 5-byte ASCII-representation of “Hello” is 5*16 = 80
bytes in the Erlang representation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strings are shared. If we write <code>L = &#34;World&#34;,</code> followed by <code>A = &#34;Hello&#34; ++ L</code>,
then A and L shares the tail, due to persistence and immutability. In some cases
this can be utilised to limit the amount of data present in a system, and
somewhat help with the massive data blowup you will otherwise see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang is not unique in having the string-as-integer-list representation. It is
the same representation which is used by Haskell. But since no type information
is present, you can’t discriminate between a list of integers and a string. You
will have to know from the code at hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of disadvantages of this representation. It results in memory
blowup, more cache misses, more data bandwidth use, and so on. On the other
hand, all the normal list-processing functions are present and can be used on
strings alike. So to manipulate strings, you have access to four modules:
<code>[string, lists, unicode, re]</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The module <code>string</code> contains valuable helper functions for manipulation of strings. Most importantly:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>string:tokens/2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>which can be used to split a string into parts, and</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>string:join/2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>which can join strings together with a separator.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I normally only use plain strings like these when the data sizes are rather
small and we are not on a critical code path. Otherwise, you need to do
something else in order to make things work quickly and efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>lists</code> module contains many functions which are useful for working with
strings. As an example, <code>lists:prefix/2</code> can be used on strings as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>re</code> module implements regular expressions. Here is the
basic rule:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do NOT use the <code>re</code> module</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, there are better ways to handle data than to supply a regular
expression to handle it. Mind you, I utterly love using regexes in editors and I
also like using them in lexers. But for most normal data processing, regular
expressions are overkill. Also, the regular expression engine in Erlang has been
altered so it preempts. This avoids a long-running regex to destroy the VM’s
scheduling mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typical code will have maybe one or two calls to the <code>re</code> module per 5000 lines
of code. If you have more than that, chances are you are trying to program PERL
in Erlang. And that is a bad idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the <code>re</code> module is way faster than the older <code>regexp</code> module which was deprecated.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_binarytype">The binary() type</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang, like Haskell, saw the problem with a memory-heavy string type. So they
both implement a type which is more efficient at handling large amounts of data.
In Erlang, this is called a <code>binary</code> and in Haskell it is called a <code>ByteString</code>.
Binaries are arrays of binary data. They are immutable, which means they can be
shared. Also, referral to subparts of a binary can be shared by having the
system store 3 values called a sub-binary:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A pointer to the original binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An offset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A size</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that sub-binaries work a bit like Go’s slice construction in this way. The
VM is built such that passing around binaries and subbinaries are always
efficient. The trick is immutability, which allows the system to pass pointers
on binaries rather than passing the binary value itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Binaries, like in Go, also has extra <em>capacity</em> in the sense that in some cases
a binary can be appended to efficiently without having to copy the binary data
to a new place. The system will automatically extend binaries with extra
capacity when they are copied, ensuring efficient append.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When programming Erlang, the compiler and VM will automatically generate
binaries and sub-binaries for you. Write your code in a straightforward and
readable manner first. Then compile your program with <code>+bin_opt_info</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>to have the compiler report on which binaries were not optimised in code which
is heavily traversed by the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Binaries can be pattern matched. This is extremely efficient, but sometimes you
can’t write a matching rule since they essentially work from the beginning
always. You can’t “search” in a binary until you hit something which matches by
a single pattern match. The way to handle this problem is by using the <code>binary</code>
module:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>binary:split/3</code> is extremely powerful. It is the binary variant of
<code>string:tokens/2</code> but it is returning shared data and so does only produce a
small amount of garbage. The split string simply refers into the original binary
through sub-binaries. Be very aware of the option “[global]” which will allow
you to split the binary into more than two parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>binary:match/3</code> is your generic search routine for picking out parts deeply in binary data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>binary:compile_pattern/1</code> allows you to build some simple compiled patterns like a weaker
(but way faster) regular expression search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>binary:copy/1</code> forces a copy of a binary. This is useful if you have a 1 megabyte binary and
you have found a 45 byte sequence in it—and you only want that sequence. Then you can copy
the sequence which means you don’t hold on to the 1 megabyte binary anymore—in turn allowing
the garbage collector to collect it. This is extremely useful if you are cutting input into
pieces (with <code>split/3</code>) and storing it at rest for a long time. For instance in ETS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_iodata_type">The iodata() type</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another quite important data type which I want to describe. These are
called <code>iodata()</code> or <code>iolists()</code>. The rule is the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A list of integers in the range 0..255 is IOData.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A binary is IOData.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lists of IOData is IOData.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, this means you can form IOData by collecting IOData as lists.
This means string concatenation in the language is O(1). <code>p(IOData) → [&#34;&lt;p&gt;&#34;, IOData, &#34;&lt;/p&gt;&#34;].</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>p/1</code> function given here will wrap IOData in a standard paragraph section
in HTML, but it will not reallocate any data, nor will it generate any garbage.
The sections “&lt;p&gt;” and “&lt;/p&gt;” are constants, so the only allocation that will
happen will be for the front of the list, two list elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most IO functions in Erlang understands IOData directly. This means you can
avoid having to flatten data, but just send the IOData out over a socket or the
like. It avoids costly allocations and copies on the IO pipe in your program.
Highly recommended!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good way to gauge how well thought out a library is is to look at how well it
handles IOData. If it doesn’t and requires you to explicitly call
<code>iolist_to_binary/1</code> then chances are the library is not that well written.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_handling_unicode_data">Handling <code>unicode()</code> data</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unicode data in Erlang is handled by the <code>unicode</code> module, which can convert between
representations of Unicode. My recommendation however, would be to keep most unicode data as UTF-8 strings
in binaries. You can match on unicode code-points:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>-module(z).
-export([len/1]).
len(B) when is_binary(B) -&gt;
len(B, 0);
len(&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;, K) -&gt; K;
len(&lt;&lt;_ /utf8, Rest/binary&gt;&gt;, K) -&gt; len(Rest, K+1).</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is useful together with the ability to input character strings as UTF-8:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>Erlang R16B03-1 (erts-5.10.4) [source-ce3d6e8] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]
[dtrace]
Eshell V5.10.4 (abort with ^G)
...2&gt; z:len(&lt;&lt;”Rødgrød med fløde”/utf8&gt;&gt;).
17
3&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Release 17.0, the default will be UTF-8 in Erlang files. This will probably
have some deep effects on Erlang source code, but it will ultimately help
getting Unicode into Erlang. Release 18.0 is planned to accept unicode atoms as
well, to open up the design space.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_attack_vectors">Attack Vectors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic rule of all Erlang string handling is this:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Never never NEVER work on stringly typed data</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When data is “stringly” typed, it means that your data has no structure and
everything are represented in strings. This is fairly expensive to work on for a
system since you are limited to use the string-handling code. Parsing is always
expensive and this hurts your processing speed. Some languagues, like awk or
perl are built to process these kind of things. But you rather do not want to do
this processing in Erlang.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way you avoid stringly typed data is to take the input and transform it as
early as possible into structured data inside your code. That way, you can avoid
working on the string data, and you only need it in a few places. The more
structure you can attach to the data, the better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary problem is when you have to work with a bad data format. Again, the
trick is to turn the bad format into something sensible quickly and then process
it as sensible data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang is designed to work with data that has structure. With structure, you can
pattern match which is fast. Without structure, you have to rely on standard
techniques and this is almost always going to be a pain in the language. So
don’t do it. Convert data into a structured format and then proceed by handling
the structure with pattern matches.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_immutability">Immutability</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang takes a stance. All data are immutable. In particular, strings are
immutable. Binaries are immutable. There will be an overhead to this stance. If
you can’t accept this, you must pick another language. That said, the advantages
of immutability far outshine the benefits of immutability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Erlang is immutable because it eliminates a large source of programming errors
and programming mistakes. After all, the value of an incorrect program is lower
than a correct one. This stance is highly unlikely to be changed, since the
safety guarantee provided by immutability is part of the Erlang-DNA.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_when_you_have_control_of_data">When you have control of data</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some situations you control the format of the data you are going to use. This
is an &lt;em class=&#34;markup—​em markup—​p-em&#34;&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; oppurtunity to pick
some clever ways of working with data. In particular to enforce structure on
data by default. If communicating between Erlang systems, you can use
<code>term_to_binary/1</code> &amp; <code>binary_to_term/2</code> and just put data at rest in the
standard Erlang-format. If the foreign system also supports this format, it is
an excellent way to interchange data. The encoder/decoder for this format is
written in C and it also handles very large terms with grace—the running process
will be preempted while producing the binary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The man page for <code>inet</code>, <code>erl -man inet / setopts\( RET</code> describes common socket
options you can set on a socket. By setting the <code>packet</code> option you can control
how the system decodes inbound data. Most interesting, you can set ASN.1 BER
encoding or Line-wise encoding. If you value speed, you should consider an
efficient binary format.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_json">JSON</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ubiquitous format today, you need to handle
is JSON data. I don’t particularly like JSON as a data exchange format, since it is very weak in what
types it encodes. I’d much rather have a format like Joe Armstrong’s UBF or the Clojure <code>edn</code> &amp; <code>data.fressian</code> encodings. But JSON it is. There are two good JSON libraries for Erlang:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">jsx </dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="http://github.com/talentdeficit/jsx" class="bare">http://github.com/talentdeficit/jsx</a></p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">jiffy</dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="http://github.com/davisp/jiffy" class="bare">http://github.com/davisp/jiffy</a></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They differ in how they are implemented. The jsx library is implemented in pure
Erlang and is the slower of the two. The jiffy library uses a C NIF (Natively
Implemented Function) to run the encoder and decoder and is about 10 times
faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beware: the jiffy library can’t be used to decode large JSON data sets. The
decoder is not a well-behaved NIF and as such it can mess up the schedulers if
it is used to decode large data strings. If the JSON takes more than 1ms to
decode, you should probably avoid using it. In Release 17.0, we get so-called
<em>dirty schedulers</em> which can be used to work around this problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other problem with JSON data is the internal
Erlang representation. Right now, there is no isomorphic mapping for JSON objects/dictionaries into
Erlang. This will be fixed in Release 17.0 as well, since it includes maps so
you can obtain a native mapping of objects/dictionaries
into Erlang data. I also have a side project on the run to properly handle JSON to Record encoding in
Erlang, but this still ongoing work. And it will take some time before it is fully implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, note that JSON will never be a fast interchange format. If
you use JSON to move large amounts of data, you are screwed. Plain and simple.
You best bet is then to hope data are sent as many small pieces so you can use
jiffy on them. Or wait till 17.0 so you can get jiffy in a dirty-scheduler
variant.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_files">Files</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should study the section “PERFORMANCE” of the man page <code>erl -man file</code> Note
that in order to have fast file I/O you need to open the file in “raw” mode, use
binaries, and you can usually also benefit by following some of the advice in
the section about performance. The general rule of IOData applies: If you supply
IOData, the underlying file driver is able to map this onto a unix <code>pwrite(2)`</code>
call which is highly efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not opening in raw mode does have its benefits
though, because you can then get the IO subsystem to work. This subsystem allow you to open a file on a
foreign file system (on another node) and then operate on that file. If you don’t need the high speed,
this is desirable in many situations, should your system span multiple nodes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_closing_off">Closing off</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a myth erlang strings are slow. You will have to think a bit more
about what you do in order for the system to speed up. But chances are that string processing won’t be
your limit. It is much more conceivable your bottleneck will have to do with a lock, or the wrong
structure of processes than it will be slow strings.</p>
