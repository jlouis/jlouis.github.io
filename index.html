      <p>The hard part is not debugging the code. The hard part is figuring out where the bug is. This is what observability is.
  — Charity Majors   I really like the notion of “observability”, which stems from Control Theory. The idea is that we have some system, with inputs, some internal state and some outputs. A system is observable if we can determine its internal state, solely from a finite set of outputs (in finite time).</p>

      <p>The core idea of GraphQL is this: let clients have a small, typed, total, functional (declarative) language where they can push programs to the server side. The server then interprets these programs and provides data to the client. The natural core for this is a lambda calculus: a GraphQL fragment is a lambda over the free variables of that fragment, for instance. A query is also a lambda, but no variables are free, and it is “exported” for others to use.</p>

      <p>Jesper, I have this idea in which we’ll connect all of the worlds Erlang systems to each other, imagine if every process could talk to every other process, world-wide!
  — Joe Armstrong   Joe was never short on ideas when you spoke to him. At conferences, he would engage people with his newest idea, or he would find people across the room and connect them. This often resulted in new acquaintances, interesting conversations, and new insights.</p>

      <p>An Erlang/OTP 20.0 optimization Edit: some word choices have been altered slightly in order to make some parts more clear.
This is a short blurb about a specific optimization present in Erlang 20.0 which is scheduled for release in June 2017. The README file mentions the following:
OTP-13529 Application(s): erts Erlang literals are no longer copied during process to process messaging. And there have been a couple of questions as to what that is and means.</p>

      <p>Suppose you have a bounded queue of size 10. In a normal setting, you system may load this queue with up to 5 elements. Under load, the queue might increase to say 7 or 8 elements, but you are not going to reach the bound of the queue. Typically the queue is empty, some elements gets added to the queue and then drained again by processing.
In contrast, suppose the queue is full at 10 elements, and that the load increases on the queue.</p>

      <p>Erlang programs, often have a a list comprehension which implements the ubiquitous serial map of functional programming:
map(F, Xs) -&gt; [F(X) || X &lt;- Xs] If, however, the function given as F blocks, then the map function blocks as well. This is not a desirable situation if the elements in Xs are truly independent. We could run all of the comprehension in parallel and then collect the data afterwards. This is the purpose of the pmap function:</p>

      <p>Often, when one hears the word “Scalable” used in a context, it is used in an informal way. It is a fuzzy term, used by people to say that their system can handle the future. As if one has divine knowledge of what happens.
What is often meant is how the system handles additional load, for some measure of load. That is, if a company is succesful, and it gains 10 times as many users as now, the system the company uses to run their business keeps operating with next to no perceivable drop in behavior.</p>

      <p>The first Go challenge is over. So by now, I can take my Erlang solution and write about how you would go around solving the challenge in Erlang. I’m deliberately skipping some details in Erlang, so don’t expect me to explain all the nitty-gritty parts. I do hope a reader with some programming language experience can follow along, even if you have had very little exposure to functional programming.
The goal of the challenge is to implement a parser for a binary format.</p>

      <p>The last couple of days, I’ve been toying with a little hobby project of mine.
The project is to rank players which player Quake Live duels, and I have reported on it before. I’ve been gathering duels since February 2012 up to now. The project is written as a hybrid. Most of the code for storage, retrieval and presentation is written in Erlang. The ranking code is written in Go.</p>

      <p>We start out with the TL;DR treatise: The mnesia database is not CP, nor AP. And it cannot be CA, because CA doesn’t make any meaningful sense. In short, it is broken with respect to the CAP theorem.
Note: Things get subtle once you begin digging into the intricacies of the CAP theorem. I am not a native speaker of English, though Danish is “dangerously close”. I apologize in advance for my mistakes, and beg of you to write a correction if I stray too far from understandable prose.</p>
