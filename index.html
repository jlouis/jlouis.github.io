      <p>The hard part is not debugging the code. The hard part is figuring out where the bug is. This is what observability is.
  &#8212; Charity Majors   I really like the notion of &#8220;observability&#8221;, which stems from Control Theory. The idea is that we have some system, with inputs, some internal state and some outputs. A system is observable if we can determine its internal state, solely from a finite set of outputs (in finite time).</p>

      <p>The core idea of GraphQL is this: let clients have a small, typed, total, functional (declarative) language where they can push programs to the server side. The server then interprets these programs and provides data to the client. The natural core for this is a lambda calculus: a GraphQL fragment is a lambda over the free variables of that fragment, for instance. A query is also a lambda, but no variables are free, and it is &#8220;exported&#8221; for others to use.</p>

      <p>Jesper, I have this idea in which we&#8217;ll connect all of the worlds Erlang systems to each other, imagine if every process could talk to every other process, world-wide!
  &#8212; Joe Armstrong   Joe was never short on ideas when you spoke to him. At conferences, he would engage people with his newest idea, or he would find people across the room and connect them. This often resulted in new acquaintances, interesting conversations, and new insights.</p>

   Mark Jason Dominus wrote about "Moonpig", which is his and Rik Signes work on building a billing system in Perl. He wrote up his story over on his blog. At Issuu, Francesco Zanitti, Anders Fugmann, and I wrote a system which has some similarities to Moonpig. This is a hash through that system. Currently, we mostly handle post-paid services.</p>

      <p>(Front Line Assembly: Civilization, Eastern Sun: In Emptiness)
 As an Erlang programmer I often claim that &#8220;You can’t pick parts of Erlang and then claim you have the same functionality. It all comes together as a whole&#8221;. This is true for many programming environments where the main components are built to be orthogonal from each other and the parts form the cohesive whole. A good example of this approach would be Go as well.</p>

      <p>One of my hobby projects is to run statistics on Quake Live Duel matches. I began collecting data around 1st of Feb 2013 and now I have scraped around \(2.5\) Million duel matches. This allows me to play with different ranking methods on the players and gauge their ranking.
  The ranking system I use is called Glicko2, devised by Mark E. Glickman (http://glicko.net). The system is like the chess rating system ELO, except that it is newer and avoids certain problems with ELO.</p>

      <p>My friend, Michael T. Richter, presented me with a nice concept from engineering. The logbook. The concept is extremely simple: you keep a log of your work, so you can refer back to it later. Yet, there are relatively few in Computer Science who does that, which is a sad state of affairs.
 The odd thing is that most computer scientists do know the importance of logging in an application.</p>

      <p>So, listening a bit to &#8220;The Civil Wars&#8221; this afternoon cooked up the rest of eVenti. This blog post is brought to you by Maurice Ravel, and Morcheeba however.[1]
 The eVenti system is a simple Erlang-implementation of the venti(8) system famous from Plan9. The idea is very simple: We can store data in Venti and the data becomes addressed by its SHA1 checksum.footenote:[I should probably change this later, but for compatibility reasons we stick to it…] This is called a Content Adressable Storage (CAS) because Content is—you guessed it—addressed by the checksum of the content.</p>

      <p>Glicko2 is a ranking system for duel games. I use it to rank Quake Live duels. The idea is to find a value, the strength of a player, called R in the system. The higher the R value, the better the player.
 How does Glicko2 estimate R? It looks at historical data and uses bayesian methods to estimate the current strength of a player. Like all other systems, there are parameters we can tune for a set of players and a set of duels:</p>

      <p>Here is our typical Erlang project. And note we are on a pretty slow Mac OSX filesystem and a 5400 RPM disk. Not the fastest in the world. If I run a rebar-compile from cold, we get the following a timing of 26 seconds. Doing the same with erlang.mk is 24 seconds. Note that erlang.mk only uses one thread, whereas rebar is parallelizing the build and is using all 4 cores in the machine.</p>
