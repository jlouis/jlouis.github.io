      <p>The hard part is not debugging the code. The hard part is figuring out where the bug is. This is what observability is.
  — Charity Majors   I really like the notion of “observability”, which stems from Control Theory. The idea is that we have some system, with inputs, some internal state and some outputs. A system is observable if we can determine its internal state, solely from a finite set of outputs (in finite time).</p>

      <p>The core idea of GraphQL is this: let clients have a small, typed, total, functional (declarative) language where they can push programs to the server side. The server then interprets these programs and provides data to the client. The natural core for this is a lambda calculus: a GraphQL fragment is a lambda over the free variables of that fragment, for instance. A query is also a lambda, but no variables are free, and it is “exported” for others to use.</p>

      <p>Jesper, I have this idea in which we’ll connect all of the worlds Erlang systems to each other, imagine if every process could talk to every other process, world-wide!
  — Joe Armstrong   Joe was never short on ideas when you spoke to him. At conferences, he would engage people with his newest idea, or he would find people across the room and connect them. This often resulted in new acquaintances, interesting conversations, and new insights.</p>

      <p>Correct Erlang usage mandates you do not write any kind of defensive code. This is called intentional programming. You write code for the intentional control flow path which you expect the code to take. And you don’t write any code for the paths which you think are not possible. Furthermore, you don’t write code for data flow which was not the intention of the program.
 It is an effect, silly If an Erlang program goes wrong, it crashes.</p>

      <p>The cat is out of the bag. Now, since WhatsApp had success using Erlang, more people will gravitate toward the platform. One of the common things that will happen as a result is that people who do not understand the string handling capabilities of the Erlang BEAM VM will fail to use it correctly. This costs a lot of unneeded clock cycles and this post aims to thwart it.
 First of all, since this is rather VM specific, it also applies to Elixir users.</p>

      <p>In any computer system, we can split the system into the part which must be correct—no matter what happens; and the part where we don’t need the system to be correct all the time.
 A typical example of this is the operating system kernel. We believe the operating system kernel to be correct, but we don’t a priori trust the userland applications. If one of those fails, the kernel can take over, reap the process by killing it and reclaim the resources the process used.</p>

      <p>The Raven that used to sing—​and other stories
   Mark Jason Dominus wrote about &#34;Moonpig&#34;, which is his and Rik Signes work on building a billing system in Perl. He wrote up his story over on his blog. At Issuu, Francesco Zanitti, Anders Fugmann, and I wrote a system which has some similarities to Moonpig. This is a hash through that system. Currently, we mostly handle post-paid services.</p>

      <p>(Front Line Assembly: Civilization, Eastern Sun: In Emptiness)
 As an Erlang programmer I often claim that “You can’t pick parts of Erlang and then claim you have the same functionality. It all comes together as a whole”. This is true for many programming environments where the main components are built to be orthogonal from each other and the parts form the cohesive whole. A good example of this approach would be Go as well.</p>

      <p>One of my hobby projects is to run statistics on Quake Live Duel matches. I began collecting data around 1st of Feb 2013 and now I have scraped around \(2.5\) Million duel matches. This allows me to play with different ranking methods on the players and gauge their ranking.
  The ranking system I use is called Glicko2, devised by Mark E. Glickman (http://glicko.net). The system is like the chess rating system ELO, except that it is newer and avoids certain problems with ELO.</p>

      <p>My friend, Michael T. Richter, presented me with a nice concept from engineering. The logbook. The concept is extremely simple: you keep a log of your work, so you can refer back to it later. Yet, there are relatively few in Computer Science who does that, which is a sad state of affairs.
 The odd thing is that most computer scientists do know the importance of logging in an application.</p>
